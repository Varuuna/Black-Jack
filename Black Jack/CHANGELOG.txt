CHANGELOG
-------------------------------------

-------------------------------------
v1.2
-------------------------------------
- Added stats that can be viewed throughout the game
by pressing the 'Q' key. It will display the number of times you've won
and the number of times the dealer has won.
Note that the game will now automatically create a "Stats" file in the
same folder as the game.
-------------------------------------
v1.1.1
-------------------------------------
- Added some text and spaces to hopefully make the flow of
the game more "visible" to the eye.
-------------------------------------
v1.1
-------------------------------------
- Fixed so that the player don't have to enter
their name every time he/she wants to play another,
consecutive round.
-------------------------------------
v1.0 (Milestone! ...Sorta!)
-------------------------------------
- The names of the cards being written to console now properly
shows as the logical verbal way of saying it.
-------------------------------------
v0.9.2
-------------------------------------
- Made the output MUCH more easier to read.
-------------------------------------
v0.9.1
-------------------------------------
- Fixed the oversight bug from v0.9 this time. I promise.
-------------------------------------
v0.9
-------------------------------------
- Fixed an oversight which caused the game to crash due to
the code trying to pull a card from the deck which didn't exist.

- Added a piece of logical code which fixed an issue that caused
the Ace to not always be of the more beneficial value to the player/dealer.
-------------------------------------
v0.8
-------------------------------------
- Added a piece of logical code to prevent the same card
from being drawn more than once in the same round.
